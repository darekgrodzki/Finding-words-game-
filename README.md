# Finding-words-game

This is a JavaScript game I've just finished. It's main concept is a game of finding polish words on the board of random letters.  The setup is based on JavaScript-PHP-MySql. The main reason to write this game was practising VanillaJS that's why it doesn't include jQuery or React.js and Ajax (it uses fetch() to communicate with database via PHP ). For now I do not include the code here, beacuse I want to clean it up first. Warning - all casses and variables have polish names.

And here is link to the game: www.slowoszukacz.pl
