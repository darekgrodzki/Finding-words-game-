# Finding-words-game

This is a JavaScript game I'm currently working on. It's main concept is a game of finding polish words on the board of random letters. At this moment it's basic functionality is working but whole game is not finished yet. The setup is based on JavaScript-PHP-MySql. The main reason to write this game is practising VanillaJS that's why it doesn't include jQuery and Ajax (it uses fetch() to communicate with database via PHP ). For now I do not include the code here, beacuse I want to finish it first.

And here is link to the game: game.substancja.eu
